### Special Thanks:
**Nillipuss** has been invaluable in helping me create and maintain this UI - Most of the special features in this UI are thanks to them either developing them in the first place or helping me to adapt them to work with this UI's Power of 2 base.
NillipussUI is highly recommended and you can find the 1080p version [here](https://github.com/NilliP/NillipussUI_1080p) and the 1440p version [here](https://github.com/NilliP/NillipussUI_1440p).

**Calmethar** was also very helpful when I started putting this UI together, particularly with the smaller buff window and spellbook. Their UI can be found [here](https://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=6959).

Special thanks as well to **Salty** and the rest of the Zeal team for adding all of these great QoL features to EQMac based UIs!
